The calendar integration allows you to integrate your calendars into Home Assistant. Calendars are shown on the calendar dashboard, and can be used with automations.

A calendar entity has state and attributes represent the next upcoming event (only). A calendar trigger is much more flexible, has fewer limitations, and is recommended for automations, instead of using the entity state.

## Automation

Calendar [Triggers](/docs/automation/trigger) enable automation based on an event start or end. Review the [Automating Home Assistant](/getting-started/automation/) getting started guide on automations or the [Automation](/docs/automation/) documentation for full details.

An example of a calendar trigger in yaml:

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: calendar
      # Possible values: start, end
      event: start
      # The calendar entity_id
      entity_id: calendar.personal
      # Optional time offset to fire a set time before or after event start/end
      offset: -00:15:00
```

Calendar triggers should generally not use automation mode `single` to ensure the trigger
can fire when multiple events start at the same time (e.g., use `queued` or `parallel` instead). Note that calendars are read once every 15 minutes. When testing, make sure you do not plan events less than 15 minutes away from the current time, or your trigger might not fire.

See [Automation Trigger Variables: Calendar](/docs/automation/templating/#calendar) for additional trigger data available for conditions or actions.

### Automation Recipes

Below are a few example ways you can use Calendar triggers.

{% details "Example: Calendar Event Notification " %}

This example automation consists of:
- For the calendar entity `calendar.personal`
- At the start of any calendar event
- Send a notification with the title and start time of the event
- Allowing multiple events starting at the same time

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  alias: Calendar notification
  trigger:
    - platform: calendar
      event: start
      entity_id: calendar.personal
  action:
    - service: persistent_notification.create
      data:
        message: >-
          Event {{ trigger.calendar_event.summary }} @
          {{ trigger.calendar_event.start }}
  mode: queued
```
{% endraw %}

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Example: Calendar Event Light Schedule " %}

This example consists of:
- For the calendar entity ` calendar.device_automation`
- When event summary contains `Front Lights`
- Turn on and off light named `light.front` when the event starts and ends

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  alias: Front Light Schedule
  trigger:
    - platform: calendar
      event: start
      entity_id: calendar.device_automation
    - platform: calendar
      event: end
      entity_id: calendar.device_automation
  condition:
    - condition: template
      value_template: "{{ 'Front Lights' in trigger.calendar_event.summary }}"
  action:
    - if:
        - "{{ trigger.event == 'start' }}"
      then:
        - service: light.turn_on
          entity_id: light.front
      else:
        - service: light.turn_off
          entity_id: light.front
  mode: queued
```
{% endraw %}

{% enddetails %}
